      "The state of New Jersey plans to ramp up offshore wind power but faces challenges due to many projects financially struggling and others physically deteriorating. To address its power needs, New Jersey must reconsider its energy sources. By lifting the ban on new nuclear power, the state can access a highly efficient and reliable power option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite concerns about nuclear waste storage, current on-site practices have been safe for decades. Nuclear power boasts an impressive capacity factor of 92.5%, outperforming wind, natural gas, and coal. New Jersey's existing Salem and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations are safe and provide power to millions of homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the increasing demand for power from data centers, New Jersey's goal of 100% clean energy by 2050 may benefit from nuclear power's reliability and lack of carbon emissions. However, the state is currently among the 12 states with restrictions on new nuclear power plants, limiting its ability to adapt to changing energy demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "As young adults, imagine being part of a team responsible for advising your state on its energy policy. How would you weigh the benefits and risks of expanding nuclear power versus other renewable options, considering factors like reliability, environmental impact, and long-term sustainability? How might you advocate for a diverse energy mix that balances current needs with future growth while staying mindful of environmental concerns?\n",
